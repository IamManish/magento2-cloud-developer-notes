# Commerce Cloud Fundamentals

#### 1.1 Describe the features and functions of Magento Commerce Cloud

###### What is Magento Cloud
###### Cloud platform overview and features

> Magento Commerce Cloud is a managed, automated hosting platform for the Magento Commerce software. Magento Commerce Cloud comes with a variety of additional features that sets it apart from the on-premise Magento Commerce and Magento Open Source platforms:
> ![Cloud Benefits](https://devdocs.magento.com/common/images/cloud/CloudBenefits.svg)
> Magento Commerce Cloud provides a pre-provisioned infrastructure that includes PHP, MySQL, Redis, RabbitMQ, and Elasticsearch technologies; a git-based workflow with automatic build and deploy for efficient Rapid development and Continuous deployment every time you push code changes in a Platform as a Service (PaaS) environment; highly Customizable environment configuration files and tools; and AWS hosting that offers a Scalable and Secure environment for online sales and retailing.

#### 1.2 Determine how to locate settings with Cloud Admin UI

###### Locate project settings, user management, and project variables pages [*](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/cloud/project/projects.html)

Log into the Project Web Interface at https://accounts.magento.cloud.

![Project settings url](https://devdocs.magento.com/common/images/cloud_project_gear.png)

Project settings url: https://eu.magento.cloud/projects/{project_id}/edit

 - User management
 - Certificates
 - Deploy Key
    > SSH key to access external private code repositories pulled during the build process.
 - Project variables
    > These variables are made available at build-time and/or runtime in all environments of the project.

###### Locate environments, access links, and logs [*](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/cloud/project/project-webint-basic.html)

![Access site](https://devdocs.magento.com/common/images/cloud_project-access.png)

![git](https://devdocs.magento.com/common/images/cloud_project-clone.png)

Logs can be filtered:
- branch (branched from ..)
- git (Name pushed to Production)
- merge (Name merged Integration into Staging)
- snapshot (Name created snapshot project_id-integration-hash of Integration - restore)
- sync (synced with the parent)
- system (env variables, user management, routes, )

![history](https://devdocs.magento.com/common/images/cloud_environment-history.png)

###### Locate environment settings

You can manage variables and settings for environments through this interface, or with CLI commands. 
Click _Configure environment_ to create and manage environments.
![Manage environment settings](https://devdocs.magento.com/common/images/cloud_project-env.png)

In the configuration page:
- Settings
    - Change environment status (Enable/Disable)
    - Outgoing emails (On/Off)
    - Indexing by search engines (On/Off)
    - HTTP access control (Basic auth + IP address access control)
- Environment-specific variables
    > These variables will be available at runtime in this environment, and will be inherited by child environments.
- Routes [?](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/cloud/project/project-conf-files_routes.html)
    > Routes allow you to set redirects or upstream settings for applications for your specific environment
- Users [?](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/cloud/project/user-admin.html)

#### 1.3 Demonstrate the ability to manage users [*](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/cloud/project/user-admin.html)

###### Add SSH key [*](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/cloud/before/before-workspace-ssh.html)

**Add a key using the CLI**

`magento-cloud ssh-key:add ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`

ssh-key cli commands:
```
  ssh-key:add                  Add a new SSH key
  ssh-key:delete               Delete an SSH key
  ssh-key:list (ssh-keys)      Get a list of SSH keys in your account
```

**Add a key using the Project Web Interface**
- In the upper right corner, click {your name} > Account Settings.
- Account Settings
- SSH Keys
- Add a public key (Title, Key)


###### Add users to a project and manage their roles
**Project-level roles**:
- Account owner
- Project administrator (Super user)
    > can change settings and execute actions on any environment, including creating and restoring snapshots
- Project reader
    > can view all environments in a project but cannot execute any actions on them

**Environment-level roles**:
- Environment administrator
    > can change settings and execute actions on this environment, including merging with the parent environment
- Environment contributor 
    > can push code to this environment and branch the environment
    > by default does not have SSH access to the environment (s. You can change the behavior in .magento.app.yaml by specifying access: ssh: contributor) 
- Environment reader

**Manage users with the CLI**
```
user:add                  Add a user to the project
user:delete               Delete a user from the project
user:get                  View a user's role(s)
user:list (users)         List project users
user:update               Update user role(s) on a project
```

After a new user is added to an environment, the environment must be rebuilt

#### 1.4 Determine the difference between Magento Cloud plans [*](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.2/cloud/architecture/cloud-architecture.html)

###### Starter plan vs. Pro differences

| Starter  | Pro  |
|----------|------|
|  Business Intelligence Essentials | Business Intelligence Pro  |
| 4 total active environments  | 8 total active environments)  |
| Platform-as-a-service (PaaS) based Production, Staging, and development environments  | Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)—dedicated virtual infrastructure for Production environments and for Staging environments (Dedicated hardware) |
| -  | High availability architecture with a three-server setup in the underlying Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) to provide enterprise grade reliability and availability  |
| _master_ branch for Production env | _production_ branch for Production env |


#### 1.5 Determine how different environment types operate

##### Determine differences in environment types: Integration, staging, production

>**Starter projects**
>
>_Integration_—The Integration environment provides three testable environments. Each environment includes an active Git branch, database, web server, caching, services, environment variables, and configurations.
>
>_Staging_—As code and extensions pass your tests, you can merge your Integration branch to a Staging environment, which becomes your pre-Production testing environment. It includes the staging active branch, database, web server, caching, services, environment variables, configurations, and services, such as Fastly and New Relic.
>
>_Production_—When code is ready and tested, all code merges to master for deployment to the Production live site. This environment includes your active master branch, database, web server, caching, third-party services, environment variables, and configurations.
>
>_Inactive_—You can have an unlimited number of inactive branches.
>
>
>**Pro projects**
>
>_Integration_—The Integration environment provides a testable environment that includes a database, web server, caching, some services, environment variables, and configurations. You can develop, deploy, and test your code before merging to the Staging environment.
>
>_Inactive_—You can have an unlimited number of inactive branches based on the Integration environment.
>
>_Staging_—The Staging environment is for pre-Production testing and includes a database, web server, caching, services, environment variables, configurations, and services, such as Fastly.
>
>_Production_—The Production environment includes a three-node, high-availability architecture for your data, services, caching, and store. This is your live, public store environment with environment variables, configurations, and third-party services.
