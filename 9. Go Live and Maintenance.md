- Update your A and CNAME records for your domains and hostnames.
- Wait for the TTL time to pass and restart your web browser.

> After checking with your registrar about where to change your DNS settings, add a CNAME record for your website that points to the Fastly service: prod.magentocloud.map.fastly.net. If you use multiple hostnames for your site, you must add a CNAME record for each one.

#### 9.2 Demonstrate ability to set up and configure Fastly

#### 9.3 Demonstrate ability to upgrade to a new version

###### Upgrade of Magento and ece-tools to newer versions
`composer update magento/ece-tools`

#### 9.4 Demonstrate ability to upsize

Magento Commerce can scale from the smallest Pro12 cluster to the largest Pro120 cluster.
- Pro12 offers a 12-CPU (4 x 3 nodes) and 48GB RAM (16 x 3 nodes)
- Pro120 offers 120 CPU (40 x 3 nodes) up to 480GB RAM (160 x 3 nodes)

For permanent upsize - contact to account manager.

For temp upzise - create support ticket or:
> During expected periods of heavy site traffic you can reach out to your Technical Account Manager to request an increase in cluster size. 
> Then when traffic re-stabilizes you can request a down-size in cluster size.
